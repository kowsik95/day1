Objects and its Internal Function:

Objects is a complex datatype in Javascript that most widely used in the modern day coding language.
Object datatypes can have all kinds of primitive datatypes as there is no specific limitation in entering 
the datas.Objects can have all the primitive datatypes like boolean,string,number,null and store it 
as a single value.Objects works on "Key:Value" pair where the datatypes can be in any format.For example

var obj = { Name : "Raja",
            Age  : 32};

here, Name is the key and value is Raja in the property of the object.We can access properties in object
by the syntax object.property 

Objects can also be written with array that forms Array of objects.Array of objects is given by a example
below:
var arrobj = [{ Name : "Raja", Age : 32},{Name : "Ram", Age : 22}]

Objects stores all the different properties in a same memory loaction that helps for easy access of the 
datas from the database.
The Speciality of the Objects is that it takes all the datas in property as a string,even if there is number
object converts it into a string so that we can also use fractional datas.
